            <!-- Founding of CRITTR -->
            <div class="about-main">
                <h1>What is CRITTR?</h1>
                <p>CRITTR was founded by Dr. Katrina E. Gobetz, Dr. Bryan A Cage, and Patricia E. Higgins. CRITTR focuses on data collecting from mammals that are extremely small. The concept for CRITTR was started when Dr. Gobetz expressed her frustrations with the current way of collecting data from these creatures. Researchers, like Dr. Gobetz, had to go out in the field and place metal traps in order to collect data on these creatures. These traps lack functionality because they only allow one animal to be collected at a time, making it very slow to gather this data. The trap can also cause the animal harm and may even be fatal in some instances.</p>
                
                <p>These three researchers decided the current method was inpractical and unethical. They decided to create a new method to collect data from these tiny mammals without hurting them. After some research and development, the OpenHouse Station was created. This device would allow researchers to collect data from these mammals without having to trap them. The device is equiped with a scale and camera. When the animal enters the station, the device records the weight, a timestamp, the current temperature/humidity, and videos/pictures of the animal. The entrance of the station is left open allowing the mammal the liberty to leave the device at anytime.</p>
                
                <p>After the data is collected from the mammal, it is sent to the CRITTR servers. The data can be seen by multiple people regardless of location from the CRITTR website. Each station owner can create a project and invite members to participate in their research. Through this website, members can add data such as species, genus, common name, and gender to what has already been collected. This new method allows people across the world to interact with one another while conducting vital research.</p>

                    <h5>Collaboration</h5>
                    <p>One of CRITTR's main goals with the OpenHouse Station was to facilitate collaboration. Being able to work with other researchers regardless of location is great for getting new perspectives. By collaborating in this way, we can work towards a common goal at much quicker rates, while also forming bonds with our fellow researchers. </p>

                    <p>This entire project is based on research. Data collection allows for new discoveries and better understandings within the designated fields of study. With this new method, researching can be conducted in a much quicker way, while also keeping in mind the safety of these small mammals. Our hope is that we can change the way people think about conducting research.</p>

                    <h5>Innovation</h5>
                    <p>CRITTR's thoughts on innovation can be summed up into a quote by Arthur C. Clarke: "The only way to discover the limits of the possible is to go beyond them into the impossible." This is why we strive to innovate. As we go further into the scientific realm, we need to constantly innovate not only our technology, but also the way we think.</p>

                    <p>Technology has allowed us to go farther into the future. Without it, our fundamental understanding of what we know wouldn't be possible. At CRITTR, we have the mind set to improve on the tech. we currently have in order to increase our research capabilities. Whether it be our field research tech. or our server-side tech., we will push forward to innovate and take that next step.</p>

                    <h5>Thought</h5>
                    <p>One of the most powerful abilities people possess is the propensity to think. Our thoughts drive innovation. Here at CRITTR, we believe the thought process is as important as the research itself. Through collaboration, a multitude of people can share their thoughts on the research, allowing for new avenues of idea exploration.</p>

                    <p>Respect is one of the fundamental aspects of society. Without it, only the negatives rise to the top. CRITTR not only refers to respecting other researchers, but we also want to show respect to the creatures we are researching. One of the primary reseaons for creating the OpenHouse Station was to eliminate the ethical issue of trapping and potentially killing the mammals we wanted to collect data on.</p>
